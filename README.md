## AIRBNB CLONE THE CONSOLE
Basically this AirBnB repository project is a root part of full web application that focuses more on writing a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.

This is a very important step of our AirBnB Project. It's kinda similar to Shell Project. It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object
